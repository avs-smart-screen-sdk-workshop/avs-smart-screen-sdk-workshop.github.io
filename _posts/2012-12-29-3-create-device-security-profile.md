### Register your prototype and create a security profile

After you've created an Amazon developer account, you'll need to create a product and security profile. This will enable your software client to connect to AVS.

Log in to [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html).  You should be in the Dashboard by default - click the **ALEXA VOICE SERVICE** button in the global navigation to start building products with Alexa built-in.  If you don't see this screen, try this link:  [https://developer.amazon.com/avs/home.html#/avs/homes](https://developer.amazon.com/avs/home.html#/avs/homes)

If this is your first time using AVS, you'll see a welcome screen. Click the **GET STARTED** button, then click the **CREATE PRODUCT** button.

If you're a returning developer that has already created products in your dashboard, click the blue **CREATE PRODUCT** button at the top right corner of the screen to start building a new device profile.

### Fill in product information

1. *Product Name*: Use **AVS Tutorials Project**.
2. *Product ID*: Use **PrototypePi.** No spaces are allowed for the *Product ID* field.
3. Select **Device with Alexa built-in** for *Please Select Your Product Type*.
  Select **No** for *Will your device use a companion app?*
4. Choose **Other** for *Product Category* and write **Prototype** in the *(please specify)* and *Brief product description* field.
5. Select **Hands-free** for *How will users interact with your product?*
7. Skip the *Upload an image* step.  This is not required for prototyping.
8. Select **No** for *Do you intend to distribute this product commercially?*
9. Select **No** for *Will your device be used for Alexa for Business?*
9. Select **No** for *Is this a children’s product or is it otherwise directed to children younger than 13 years old?*
10. Click **NEXT** to continue.

### Set up your security profile

1. Click **CREATE NEW PROFILE**.  

2. Enter your own custom **Security Profile Name** and **Security Profile Description** for the following fields - or use the below example names:   
	 - *Security Profile Name*: **AVS Tutorials Project**
	 - *Security Profile Description*: **AVS Tutorials**
	 - Click **NEXT**.  

	 **Security Profile ID** will be generated for you.

   - Write a name for your Client ID here - you can just use **Prototype**.
   - Click "Generate ID".  You should get a Client ID and an option to download it.
   - If you're creating this product profile on your Raspberry Pi, click **Download** to get your credentials onto your AVS prototype.  When you click download, it'll automatically put it in your `/home/pi/downloads` folder.
   - Check the box beside *I agree to the AVS agreement and the AVS Program Requirements.*
	 - Click **FINISH**.


Congratulations!  You now have access to the Alexa Voice Service APIs.  Click OK on the prompt to continue.  Your device should now be listed on your [AVS dashboard](https://developer.amazon.com/avs/home.html#/avs/homes).
