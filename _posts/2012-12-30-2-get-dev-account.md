{:.steps}
### Register for an Amazon Developer Account

Unless you already have one, go ahead and create a free developer account at [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html). This will allow you to create an Alexa Built In device so that your Raspberry Pi can authenticate and connect to the Alexa Service. Click "sign in" at the upper right corner and create your account (or log in with your existing credentials).  You can review the **AVS Terms and Agreements** [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/support/terms-and-agreements).

(TIP) If you run into trouble authenticating or logging in initially - you can try using Ingconito mode on your browser or your mobile phone.
